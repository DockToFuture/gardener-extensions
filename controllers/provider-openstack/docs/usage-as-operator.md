# Using the OpenStack provider extension with Gardener as operator

The [`core.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.CloudProfile` resource](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/30-cloudprofile.yaml) declares a `providerConfig` field that is meant to contain provider-specific configuration.

In this document we are describing how this configuration looks like for OpenStack and provide an example `CloudProfile` manifest with minimal configuration that you can use to allow creating OpenStack shoot clusters.

## `CloudProfileConfig`

The cloud profile configuration contains information about the real machine image IDs in the OpenStack environment (image names).
You have to map every version that you specify in `.spec.machineImages[].versions` here such that the OpenStack extension knows the image ID for every version you want to offer.

It also contains optional default values for DNS servers that shall be used for shoots.
In the `dnsServers[]` list you can specify IP addresses that are used as DNS configuration for created shoot subnets.

Also, you have to specify the keystone URL in the `keystoneURL` field to your environment.

Additionally, you can influence the HTTP request timeout when talking to the OpenStack API in the `requestTimeout` field.
This may help when you have for example a long list of load balancers in your environment.

The cloud profile config also contains constraints for floating pools and load balancer providers that can be used in shoots.

An example `CloudProfileConfig` for the OpenStack extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: openstack.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: CloudProfileConfig
machineImages:
- name: coreos
  version: 2135.6.0
  image: coreos-2135.6.0
keystoneURL: https://url-to-keystone/v3/
# dnsServers:
# - 10.10.10.11
# - 10.10.10.12
# requestTimeout: 60s
constraints:
  floatingPools:
  - name: fp-pool-1
#   loadBalancerClasses:
#   - name: lb-class-1
#     floatingSubnetID: "1234"
#     floatingNetworkID: "4567"
#     subnetID: "7890"
  loadBalancerProviders:
  - name: haproxy
```
